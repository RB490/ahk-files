problem -> i feel the code as of right now has become too cluttered

bug -> not sure how to reproduce but addoninfo/addonimage.jpg tends to remain in the dev folder
    also sits in the 'backupDir' even though they obviously shouldnt

testing -> use the program in various ways
    modify an existing hud
    create a new hud
    any amount of more stuff

feature -> hud template(s)
    addonimage/addoninfo file, hudlayout.res and the teampanel stuff. possibly the tab menu aswell

feature ->  a 'showoff' hud, or multiple huds to switch to to view certain tricks eg:
    move a bunch of different background panels onto the main screen
    with border, without border. with/without transparency or whatever
    and have these available to switch to from the SwitchtoHud menu. but not the main menu
    making them work for both games with the same file would be a big bonus
    also copy the hud into a_temp before loading it to prevent changes being made
    or apply read-only
    also add addonimage

visual improvement -> add icons to (some) editor menu options
    do (some of) the main menu options but not their submenus. eg: Debug>Give/Switch Team

feature -> about + readme -> create readme file that is used in the about gui & readme
    add gif of updating hudlayout.res then the game hud changing
    recommend using vscode workspace with the valve .kv support extension
    explain generally how the program works
        creates separate 'hud editing' game version
        copies hud folder files into game folder, restoring the default ones afterwards
    commands
        can't send commands to the game in the main menu homescreen, use mouse click coords
        use the correct 'reload' mode depending on hud & main menu otherwise commands don't work

refactor -> every file, goal:
    create classes for certain 'function groups' like text editor / 'setinfofor'?
    (almost) no duplicate code
    short class methods/functions that only perform one task
    descriptive names for variables/classes/functions etc.
    in general decently structured code that is easy to read and understand

feature idea -> custom map with some usefull features (all of this so far could be done with commands, pretty much)
    room with different solid coloured walls/floor/ceiling eg. black/white
    all weapons & items
    ^ not doing this right now because
        the added value is low and fuck the hammer editor
        would need separate maps for l4d 1 & 2
