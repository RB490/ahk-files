Features #1

Design a gui for:

Add & delete timed hotkeys
* eg: create hotkey for E to be pressed every X seconds

Add hotkeys for hotkey to be pressed when health or mana is below X percent (or below value? Either read from memory or use image detection to read number from game window)
* Add health input and calculate which percentage is how much health which can be used to set to drink pot under % health or number
 * example: player has 1315 health, 1% of healthbar is 13.15 health. to drink a potion at 600 health script would have to be set to drink pot at 45.62% healthbar remaining

Option to choose between notifying skill timers /health and action upon them

Integrate loot script
* Options for setting long/short cooldown keys etc
* Enter & escape hotkeys to suspend and pause script

Ability to set a warning after using X amount of health and or mana pots
Ability to enable a warning after using a lot of the same potion in a short time, for example when the game is lagging

Check pixel colors around the health & mana bar to detect if another window is covering up maplestory's window. Enable some kind of warning when this is the case
* Look into capturing window even if another window is infront of it?

Detect ingame lag somehow to avoid spamming pots and re-applying boosts when game is lagging
